Be sure to observe current orders on the number of people allowed to gather at a single location. At Hope Cemetery, please note that all water spigots will not be operational on the recommendation of public health officials, because of the number of individuals who could touch them and the overwhelming challenge to keep them disinfected.

During the pandemic, Andy and his team in the Neighborhood and Housing Division moved quickly and efficiently to lay the groundwork for the City to receive CARES Act funding for our entitlement programs – CDBG, ESG and HOPWA. Through their collective work Worcester was the first municipality in the state to get HUD approval of a substantial amendment to its Action Plan, allowing for receipt of the CARES Act funding. Andy was also instrumental in managing the procurement of equipment, such as portable showers, that was necessary for the operation of the temporary homeless shelters and for our frontline DPW workers. Through the COVID-19 relief efforts, Andy has embodied a teamwork mentality. Andy’s division stepped up to assist the Business & Community Development Division with processing small business grant applications as quickly as possible.

Today, the City Manager recognized another group of unsung heroes in the City workforce: the Worcester Police Department. This is especially timely with this week being recognized as National Police Week (May 10-May 16). Chief Sargent and the men and women of the Worcester PD work hard everyday to make Worcester as safe as it can be. That work has not stopped due to COVID-19. Officers are still responding to calls for service and are working with the community to maintain positive relationships. If officers observe violations of the Governor’s mandatory mask order, they are encouraged to hand out masks to the violators. The focus is on educating the public about the use of masks to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The masks provided by officers are used as a community policing tool to gain compliance. Citations can be issued as a last resort. So far, there has been a positive response. The Neighborhood Response Team continues to conduct neighborhood meetings virtually via Zoom. As identified in this week’s report to City Council, in March and April there have been overall declines in both property crime and violent crime. These crime stats have been and will continue to be closely reviewed during the pandemic to better understand how the virus is impacting both law enforcement and the community. WPD also continues to monitor domestic violence incidents since cases have increased globally due to the pandemic. Worcester police detectives have been working with their community partners to protect those at risk.

The City of Worcester COVID-19 information line can be reached at 508-799-1019. Individuals can speak live with a nurse, Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

COVID-19 UPDATE FOR APRIL 30; 2,071 POSITIVE CASES
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 4/30/2020 5:33 PM

The City of Worcester has released the following COVID-19 update for April 30:

There are 2,071 confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 in the City of Worcester. This is an increase of 82 cases.

All combined medical facilities of Saint Vincent Hospital and UMass Memorial Health Care had 269 total COVID-positive in-patients and 107 total COVID-positive ICU patients today. To date, their facilities have had 106 total COVID-related deaths. A total of 172 of their employees have tested positive for the virus.

The homeless shelter at the DCU Center has 33 positive clients today. Between three to five clients are projected to be discharged today. The DCU had 18 non-homeless medical patients today.

Beaumont Rehabilitation census: 65 positive patients are currently at the Beaumont facility (4 admissions today; 8 discharges today). 

Testing: The City along with UMass Memorial and Worcester EMS have coordinated testing at several locations in the City this week: 58 residents of The Albion were tested by Worcester EMS yesterday, 4/29. A total of 18 residents tested positive for COVID-19. Clients of the SMOC shelter at 25 Queen Street are being tested today, 4/30, by Worcester EMS.

The City issued a cease and desist order to Walmart at 25 Tobias Boland Way yesterday after becoming aware Wednesday morning that a number of employees had tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. After the city's Inspectional Services Department visited the location, the store was closed by 3 p.m. yesterday afternoon. Walmart has operated in full compliance with the order to close and had a professional cleaning company clean the store overnight on Wednesday. Testing of approximately 400 Walmart employees is currently underway by Worcester EMS. Results are typically available within 24 hours. Approximately 275 employees will be tested by the end of today. The rest of the employees are scheduled to be tested tomorrow morning. Per the order, the store cannot reopen until any employees who would be scheduled to work are tested and the results are obtained. The City Medical Director would then sign off and Walmart could determine when it will reopen to the public.

Pets and COVID-19: Recent reports suggest pets can contract the virus that causes COVID-19, that it can spread from people to animals in some situations. The CDC is now issuing recommendations and advisories related to pets and COVID. The CDC recommends social distancing for dogs, cats and other animals. Cats should stay inside if possible, and when walking dogs, keep them at least six feet away from other animals and people. The CDC also advises it is best to avoid dog parks and other public places where lots of people and dogs gather. As such, today the City Manager has ordered all three dog parks in the City of Worcester closed until further notice. The Parks Department has closed the parks today and has put up signage. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. The risk of animals spreading the virus to people is considered to be low. People should take precautions around pets when or if they suspect they are sick. If sick or in isolation, extend that to pets. For more information about COVID-19 and animals, visit cdc.gov.
The Worcester Together Fund has raised more than $5.8 million in five weeks, distributing almost $850,000 in grants to area agencies and organizations. Worcester Together recently received a gift of $470,000 from the Massachusetts COVID-19 Relief Fund as well as a gift of $25,000 from Country Bank. City of Worcester employees have raised more than $3,500 for the fund to date. The FaceMask Challenge has raised $10,743 with 218 donors. To donate to the fund, visit worcesterma.gov/coronavirus or text worcestercovid19 to 243725.

Senior update: Number of seniors contacted to date: 5,556; Number of outreach calls made today: 274; Number of meals delivered today: 1,015.

The City of Worcester COVID-19 information line can be reached at 508-799-1019. There is an option for individuals to speak live with a nurse, Monday through Friday 9 am to 4 pm. 

Today, the City Manager honored another unsung hero within the City workforce, Mike Glaser. Mike joined the city just a few months ago in December as a Data Officer in the newly-established Office of Urban Innovation. In that capacity he performs data and predictive analytics as well as performance metrics. When the COVID-19 crisis struck, Mike was assigned to our Emergency Operations Center on Coppage Drive. There, he manages any and all data related to the EOC operation. A Maryland native, he earned his Bachelor’s Degree at Notre Dame University, where both his parents also went to school. He got his master’s degree from Clark University. He also served in the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone. In short order, Mike has become a vital member of the City team, and like so many others, leapt into action as needed to help deal with the coronavirus.

A total of 18 residents tested positive for COVID-19. Clients of the SMOC shelter at 25 Queen Street are being tested today, 4/30, by Worcester EMS.

The City issued a cease and desist order to Walmart at 25 Tobias Boland Way yesterday after becoming aware Wednesday morning that a number of employees had tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. After the city's Inspectional Services Department visited the location, the store was closed by 3 p.m. yesterday afternoon. Walmart has operated in full compliance with the order to close and had a professional cleaning company clean the store overnight on Wednesday. Testing of approximately 400 Walmart employees is currently underway by Worcester EMS. Results are typically available within 24 hours. Approximately 275 employees will be tested by the end of today. The rest of the employees are scheduled to be tested tomorrow morning. Per the order, the store cannot reopen until any employees who would be scheduled to work are tested and the results are obtained. The City Medical Director would then sign off and Walmart could determine when it will reopen to the public.

Pets and COVID-19: Recent reports suggest pets can contract the virus that causes COVID-19, that it can spread from people to animals in some situations. The CDC is now issuing recommendations and advisories related to pets and COVID. The CDC recommends social distancing for dogs, cats and other animals. Cats should stay inside if possible, and when walking dogs, keep them at least six feet away from other animals and people. The CDC also advises it is best to avoid dog parks and other public places where lots of people and dogs gather. As such, today the City Manager has ordered all three dog parks in the City of Worcester closed until further notice. The Parks Department has closed the parks today and has put up signage. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. The risk of animals spreading the virus to people is considered to be low. People should take precautions around pets when or if they suspect they are sick. If sick or in isolation, extend that to pets. For more information about COVID-19 and animals, visit cdc.gov.
The Worcester Together Fund has raised more than $5.8 million in five weeks, distributing almost $850,000 in grants to area agencies and organizations. Worcester Together recently received a gift of $470,000 from the Massachusetts COVID-19 Relief Fund as well as a gift of $25,000 from Country Bank. City of Worcester employees have raised more than $3,500 for the fund to date. The FaceMask Challenge has raised $10,743 with 218 donors. To donate to the fund, visit worcesterma.gov/coronavirus or text worcestercovid19 to 243725.

Senior update: Number of seniors contacted to date: 5,556; Number of outreach calls made today: 274; Number of meals delivered today: 1,015.

The City of Worcester COVID-19 information line can be reached at 508-799-1019. There is an option for individuals to speak live with a nurse, Monday through Friday 9 am to 4 pm. 

Today, the City Manager honored another unsung hero within the City workforce, Mike Glaser. Mike joined the city just a few months ago in December as a Data Officer in the newly-established Office of Urban Innovation. In that capacity he performs data and predictive analytics as well as performance metrics. When the COVID-19 crisis struck, Mike was assigned to our Emergency Operations Center on Coppage Drive. There, he manages any and all data related to the EOC operation. A Maryland native, he earned his Bachelor’s Degree at Notre Dame University, where both his parents also went to school. He got his master’s degree from Clark University. He also served in the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone. In short order, Mike has become a vital member of the City team, and like so many others, leapt into action as needed to help deal with the coronavirus.

COVID-19 UPDATE FOR APRIL 22; 1,445 POSITIVE CASES
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 4/22/2020 5:44 PM

The City of Worcester has released the following COVID-19 update for April 22:

There are 1,445 confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 in the City of Worcester (an increase of 206 positive cases from Tuesday, April 21). 

Since April 1, Worcester has seen an increase of 1,330 new cases (average of 63 new cases per day over the last 21 days).

Positive case counts in surrounding towns: Shrewsbury: 143; Holden: 35, Grafton: 43; Leicester: 59; Millbury: 133  

Note on the reporting of positive cases: The City's public health team received notice yesterday that there was a technical issue in the MAVEN system over the weekend. MAVEN is the statewide database used for communicable disease surveillance. Some cases entered into MAVEN were not being counted accurately unless two advanced reports were run. The epidemiologist at WDPH ran these reports and extracted cases that had been left out of the overall Worcester count. It is unclear at this time if today’s increase in cases (+206) is an effect of this issue over the weekend or a result of the surge. This situation is not unique to Worcester and has impacted cities and towns across the state, including the alliance communities.

The Worcester Police Department has had 5 positive cases to date (2 of the positive members are quarantined and 3 have returned to work). There are two officers in self-quarantine awaiting test results.

The Worcester Fire Department has had 6 positive cases to date. All six positive members have returned to work. One member is in self-quarantine due to exposure.

All combined medical facilities of Saint Vincent Hospital and UMass Memorial Health Care had 243 total COVID-positive in-patients today, which includes 88 total COVID-positive ICU patients. To date, their facilities have had 66 total COVID-related deaths. A total of 137 of their employees have tested positive for the virus.

The homeless shelter at the DCU Center has 58 positive homeless clients as of today. The field hospital site at the DCU Center had 25 patients (non-homeless) as of today.

Beaumont Rehabilitation census: 64 positive cases are currently housed at the Beaumont facility (3 admissions today; 3 discharges today).

As a follow up to a question asked at yesterday's briefing, drop off locations that are open and accepting sharps/needles are: Family Health Center - 26 Queen Street - 8 am-8 pm; AIDS Project Worcester - 85 Green Street - 9 am – 3 pm; Edward M. Kennedy Center - 19 Tacoma Street – 8:30 am -5 pm (See the nurse in the front); Shrewsbury Health Department - Only accepting sharps for Shrewsbury residents at this time.

The City has fielded questions about the order to wear a face mask (recently ordered employees and patrons of retail, public-facing stores to wear them) and what constitutes a face covering. A face covering can include anything covering your nose and mouth (dust masks, scarves, bandanas). A homemade face covering is perfectly acceptable. The CDC advises the use of simple face cloth coverings to slow the spread of the virus. Face coverings/masks should be worn in situations when you cannot maintain proper social distancing of 6 feet. People should not use health care worker masks, such as N95s, which should be reserved for health care workers and other medical first responders.

Today marks the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. On Earth Day, and every day, please be careful not to litter. Particularly during this crisis, don’t discard of gloves and masks on the ground. Be sure to properly dispose of them in trash receptacles. 
Today the City Manager visited the City's Sewer Department. The department oversees 398 miles of sanitary sewers; 370 miles of surface sewers (storm drains for street runoff); 61 miles combined sewers (storm water & sewage); 28,000 manholes; 15,000 catch basins (capture rain runoff); 30 pump stations; Close to 40,000 residential/commercial/industrial connections to sanitary sewer system.

To date, Worcester Together has raised almost $4.9 million and distributed grants totaling almost $750,000. Grants from $5,000 to $50,000 have been given out to dozens of organizations to meet immediate and long-term needs. To donate please visit: worcesterma.gov/coronavirus or text worcestercovid19 to 243725.

Senior Center update: Number of seniors contacted to date: 4,449; Outreach phone calls: 182 calls made today; Number of meals delivered today: 1,072.

The City of Worcester COVID-19 information line can be reached at 508-799-1019. There is an option for individuals to speak live with a nurse, Monday through Friday 9 am to 4 pm. More than 3,600 calls have been received; more than 820 calls have been connected to a live nurse.
Today the City Manager honored another unsung hero within the City workforce, Susan DiTaranto, administrative assistant for the Worcester Division of Public Health. Sue has been with the City family for more than 22 years, holding various administrative and finance positions with the Department of Code Enforcement, Department of Health and Human Services and the Division of Public Health. During the pandemic response, Sue didn’t hesitate to fill the Finance Section Chief role as part of the Emergency Operation’s Center Incident Command. She has spent the last four weeks working around the clock to support EOC operations by closely tracking all expenditures associated with the COVID-19 response. Despite this new role for her, Sue has seamlessly become part of the team that provides critical support to ensure the EOC and the City have all the supplies and support services needed to keep City employees and some of the most vulnerable populations safe and healthy.

Her commitment to elder affairs spans 30 plus years, including many years as a member of the Mass. Councils on Aging (MCOA) board of directors.

COVID-19 UPDATE FOR APRIL 3; 267 POSITIVE CASES
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 4/3/2020 7:03 PM

Out of an abundance of caution and effective immediately, all City-sponsored construction projects will be suspended until at least Monday, May 4.

The City will constantly monitor circumstances and adjust the time period of the suspension as necessary. Essential work to secure sites for the suspension may continue at certain sites until early next week.

The City will take advantage of the Municipal Challenges Bill signed by the Governor today. There is a local option to assist those financially affected by COVID-19 to have more time to make payments on recent FY20 taxes (excise, real estate), assessments and water and sewer bills. The City understands the stress that many residents and businesses are under during this unprecedented time and are making every effort possible to alleviate that pressure.

The City will delay the due date for municipal property tax bills to June 1. The City will also waive the payment of interest and other penalties on late payments that were due after March 10 and paid before June 30 for any excise, tax, betterment assessment, water or sewer bill, or other charge added to a tax.

First responders update: The Worcester Police Department has 2 positive cases and 6 quarantined. The Worcester Fire Department has 6 positive cases and 25 quarantined.

No one currently has symptoms. All staff/volunteers can continue work unless they become symptomatic. All staff/volunteers and clients will wear masks at all sites moving forward.

Worcester Tech Medical Shelter Update: Currently 5 patients total; 3 positive cases; 2 patients under investigation

DCU Center: The National Guard completed their mission yesterday afternoon. Space is currently occupied by about 30 UMass employees, City of Worcester staff and DCU employees. Medical supply inventory is underway with supplies provided by FEMA. Planning continues on: getting a generator connected to the power supply, internet connectivity, food distribution and final floor plans.

DPW site visit: Today, the City Manager and  Dr. Hirsh met with street and sanitation workers at DPW. Equipment and materials have been made available (e.g. gloves, masks, misters to clean down equipment/vehicles, a shower facility for use before leaving work for the day). Street and sanitation employees will use appropriate PPE, such as puncture resistant gloves, and face and eye protection.

Information on proper disposal of trash and recycling can be found on the City’s website at worcesterma.gov/trash-recycling. Residents should follow City ordinances about not tampering /touching anyone else’s solid waste and recycling in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.

The City's Street and Sanitation department remains fully staffed to provide essential services to residents. The City has developed a staff rotation for DPW employees to take all feasible steps to minimize potential exposure to staff, while ensuring continuity of our essential operations. Employees who need to gain entrance into homes for water and sewer issues will be equipped with proper PPE protocol gear out of an abundance of caution.

There are 3 new confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 in the City of Worcester. There are now 19 overall confirmed positive cases in Worcester. All 19 individuals are being monitored by the Worcester Division of Public Health and are in isolation.

Individuals that have been tested and received a positive result, regardless of where they were tested, MUST call their Department of Public Health and report it to a Public Health Nurse. Worcester residents can call WDPH at 508-799-8531.

Today, the Baker-Polito Administration filed An Act to Further Address Challenges Faced by Municipalities and School Districts Resulting from COVID-19, which would provide administrative relief to state and local government entities impacted by COVID-19, including modifying local permitting processes, enabling municipalities to extend tax and finance deadlines, and extending deadlines for certain education requirements.

The City Manager visited the Worcester Police Department today where he was briefed on plans and protocols relating to impacted police officers and how the City can ensure continuity of operations. He was also briefed on protocols relating to the cleaning of vehicles.

Several working groups and task forces, made up of City personnel, social service agencies and members of the faith-based and business sectors, have been established to help address varied needs. Caring for the public in a time of crisis requires partnership and collaboration to ensure the necessary resources and assistance is delivered to those in need, especially those in our most vulnerable populations. Working groups include: Housing, Elder Affairs, Food Security, Volunteerism, Well-Being and Mental Health and Worcester Together.

The Cannabis Control Commission has issued a cease and desist order to all adult-use marijuana operators effective at 12 p.m. today, and lasting until 12 p.m. on Tuesday, April 7. This order does NOT apply to medical marijuana operations.

Public restrooms at the Hub have been closed and the Dunkin Donuts’ at that facility has been closed indefinitely. The cleaning/disinfecting schedule at the Hub has been increased and each bus is equipped with a driver protection shield. The driver space, fare boxes and fare card processing equipment are disinfected daily. Personal protection equipment and sanitizing wipes/lotions are available to all drivers. The current fare-collection system employed by the WRTA minimizes driver-passenger contact. Drivers do not make change, and there is no contact between drivers and passenger in fare collection. There has been a decrease in ridership that will require changes to scheduling and availability of buses but the WRTA will be providing additional information on any changes in the coming days.

City of Worcester  first responders are taking advantage of priority testing that has been set up by the federal government. A total of 26 first responders were tested today.

COVID-19 UPDATE FOR MARCH 22; 13 POSITIVE CASES
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 3/22/2020 5:29 PM

The City of Worcester has released the following COVID-19 update for March 22:

There is 1 new confirmed positive case of COVID-19 in Worcester, which brings the overall total to 13 confirmed positive cases in the city.

All 13 individuals are being monitored by the Worcester Division of Public Health and are in isolation.

City of Worcester first responders are taking advantage of priority testing that has been set up by the federal government. To date, 19 Worcester Police officers have been tested and 18 Worcester firefighters were scheduled to be tested on March 22. This amounts to a total of 37 first responders being tested thus far.

On March 22 the City Manager met with the CEOs of UMass Medical and St. Vincent’s Hospital, along with Dr. Erik Garcia (UMass), the medical director of the Homeless Outreach and Advocacy Project, on contingency planning for surge capacity should there be a need for it in the future. This would include sheltering for homeless that have been tested or test positive for COVID-19 in addition to possible facilities for hospital overflow.

Local hospitals are in desperate need of blood donations, especially platelets. The process takes about 75 minutes and can be scheduled by calling 508-421-1901. For general blood donations, appointments are best scheduled online at redcrossblood.org.

Governor Baker has convened a COVID-19 Command Center tasked with securing funding for local public health. City of Worcester director of public health Karyn Clark serves as the representative for both Worcester and the Central Mass Regional Public Health Alliance. Worcester will receive $100,000. Other funds will come to the City for dispersal among the City’s six regional towns in the Alliance (Grafton, Holden, Leicester, Millbury, Shrewsbury, and West Boylston). Emergency funds can be used for: surveillance and case identification, monitoring of travelers, data management, isolation and quarantine, surge staffing and risk communications support.

MassHire has launched an online tool at masshirecentral.com to connect residents with employers who have urgent non-medical COVID-19 staffing needs. More than 50 people who are seeking employment opportunities have already registered. Businesses that may be experiencing a staffing shortage are also encouraged to sign up and be matched with those who are seeking employment.

The Worcester Public Schools website, worcesterschools.org, features a wealth of information for parents and students, including the schedules for free breakfast, lunch and supper meals; the coronavirus; and the WPS Extended Learning Website.

Packets containing lists of activities and other information went home with all students. Students can login to the CLEVER program via the WPS website and access classroom work. WPS has been connecting to parents via ConnectED calls in all languages used in the WPS. Principals, students, teachers and community members have also been reading books via the WPS website.

A text line has been established to facilitate donations for the Worcester Together fund. Text worcestercovid19 to 243725, then click on the link you receive and follow the instructions to donate by check or credit card.

The City of Worcester COVID-19 information line can be reached at 508-799-1019. This service is available in English, Spanish, Vietnamese and Albanian. An option is available for individuals with positive or pending test results to speak live with a nurse, Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

COVID-19 UPDATE FOR MARCH 20; SEVEN POSITIVE CASES
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 3/20/2020 5:59 PM

The City of Worcester has released the following COVID-19 update for March 20:

As of March 20, there are 2 new confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 to report in the City of Worcester. There are now 7 overall positive cases in Worcester. There are a total of 20 positive cases in Worcester County. 

All 7 individuals are being monitored by the Worcester Division of Public Health and remain in isolation.

In accordance with Governor Charlie Baker's briefing on March 20, there is no shelter in place order or quarantine order at this time for Massachusetts, including Worcester.

The sheltering plan for the adult homeless population in Worcester has begun. The shelter at North High School opened today at 4 p.m. 

North High School is one of two sites that will be up and running for this weekend. Worcester Technical High School at 1 Skyline Drive will be online Saturday, March 21.

Two additional sites will come online next week: Ascension Church at 44 Vernon Street; and St. John’s Church at 44 Temple Street.

The City is partnering with the local medical community and WDPH to staff and supply the shelters with the necessary items. The following shelter items were received today: 300 comfort kits from the Salvation Army; the Worcester Fire Department and the Worcester Police Department each received 400 more n95 masks.

The City is preparing for the next phase of sheltering for the medical overflow community and is coordinating with the Family Health Center to screen individuals prior to entering a shelter facility.

In accordance with the state, the City will begin testing first responders at a designated testing site. This will include Worcester Firefighters, Worcester Police Officers and 9-1-1 dispatchers.

The Worcester Together fund has raised a total of $1.9 million. The Greater Worcester Community Foundation (GWCF) fund has raised $1.25 million. The United Way fund has raised $670,000. The George I. Alden Trust has given $500,000 each to the GWCF and United Way, for a total of $1 million.

Together with MassHire, and the Worcester Regional Chamber of Commerce, the City has helped launch an online platform to connect residents with employers who have urgent non-medical COVID-19 staffing needs. This is a quick and easy way to connect low-risk people looking to work (including those who’ve been laid off) with area employers during this crisis. Employers and job seekers can now access this platform at masshirecentral.com.

The Worcester Public Schools free Healthy Meals to Go feeding program has provided 2,600 meals this week to children/families in need. The schedule is available here.

The Worcester Fire Department (WFD) is asking residents, landlords and those who own property to be keenly aware of the dangers of smoking outside their homes. Specifically, two recent fires have highlighted the dangers of smoking on porches. Understanding people may be less mobile now, and staying at home more as a result of COVID-19, the WFD strongly encourages residents to be mindful of the dangers of smoking on their porches.

COVID-19 UPDATE FOR MARCH 19; FIFTH POSITIVE CASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 3/19/2020 5:58 PM

The City of Worcester has released the following COVID-19 update for March 19:

As of March 19, there is 1 new positive case of COVID-19 to report in the City of Worcester. There are now 5 overall positive cases in the City of Worcester. (There are 11 positive cases in Worcester County.)

All 5 individuals continue to be monitored by the Worcester Division of Public Health and remain in isolation.

The City will begin a sheltering program for the adult homeless population starting Friday, March 20.

The goal for this program is to provide a safe and healthy environment for one of our most vulnerable populations. This is an increased effort to comply with the guidelines and practice appropriate social distancing.

The City is also working with local hospitals to identify applicable locations should emergency rooms and hospitals become overcrowded.

Two sites will be up and running this weekend: North High School Gymnasium at 150 Harrington Way will be online Friday, March 20; Worcester Technical High School at 1 Skyline Drive will be online Saturday, March 21.

Two additional sites will come online next week: Ascension Church at 44 Vernon Street and St. John’s Church at 44 Temple Street.

The state guidance of no more than 25 individuals will be maintained and the ongoing needs of the community will continue to be assessed. (Total of 100 capacity at the four sites combined).

Each site will have security, a Worcester Police Department presence, food distribution, City representation and medical personnel. These will be 24-hour a day operations and include three shifts.

The City is partnering with Richie Gonzalez (Net of Compassion and Hotel Grace), to coordinate management and staffing of each shelter.

Staffing models will be established for each location and we are partnering with the Worcester Public Schools on maintenance and access.

Each site has proper shower capabilities – the City is sourcing for remote showers for both Ascension Church and St. John’s Church.

Food will be provided seven days a week through the school nutrition program and St. John’s Food for the Poor.

Volunteers will provide daily activities at the shelters in accordance with the 25 person capacity guidelines.

SMOC shelter at 25 Queen Street will serve as the main entry point for sheltering.

SMOC and the WPS/Durham will provide transportation from Queen Street to the satellite locations.

The City has also announced a Small Business Resiliency Grant Program to help those businesses affected by this crisis.

Through HUD Community Development Block Grant funding, a total of $500,000 will be provided with a $10,000 max per business.

Eligible applicants include business owners who have a low-to moderate income status; a physical location within the City of Worcester; experienced a loss of revenue of 50% or more due to COVID-19 since March 10; have less than $2M in gross receipts.

Funding is limited, but the City is hoping to provide some relief for at least 50 businesses that are significantly vulnerable.

We hope to recapitalize the program and expand eligibility if additional CDBG funds are part of the federal stimulus efforts.

The application form will be live at worcesterma.gov/coronavirus starting Monday, March 23, with instructions for submission.

Spanish, Vietnamese and Albanian speakers on staff will be available for assistance with language barriers.

Worcester Together has already raised $1.7M since its inception this week.

Both the City and the Worcester Police Department would like to remind everyone that restaurants and bars are prohibited from serving food and drinks for on-premises consumption due to the ongoing public health concerns related to COVID-19.

On March 18, the Worcester Police Department Alcohol Enforcement Unit observed that the Vintage Grille at 346 Shrewsbury Street was open for business with numerous patrons consuming food and drinks.

An officer applied for a criminal complaint and the incident will be referred to the License Commission and Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission for further sanctions.

ALL City playgrounds remain closed to the public at this time. Public signage with this information has been posted at all playgrounds. Our open spaces (fields, greenspace) remain available for use.

The AlertWorcester emergency communications system has seen a marked uptick in subscriptions. Since March 9, an additional 953 households have signed up for the service in addition to 776 new text subscribers and 325 new email subscribers. City residents are encouraged to sign up for this service here.

The COVID-19 information line can be reached at 508-799-1019. This service is available in English, Spanish, Vietnamese and Albanian. Individuals with positive or pending test results can speak live with a nurse, Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Since launch, the information line has received nearly 700 calls.

COVID-19 UPDATE FOR MARCH 18; FOURTH POSITIVE CASE
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 3/18/2020 6:28 PM

The City of Worcester has released the following COVID-19 update for March 18:

As of March 18, there is 1 new positive case of COVID-19 in the City of Worcester. There are now 4 overall positive cases.

All 4 individuals are being monitored by the Worcester Division of Public Health and remain in isolation.

There is 1 person under investigation by the Worcester Division of Public with test results still pending.

The City's Communications Center (9-1-1 and dispatch) was split into two sites and a third site is being planned. Additional dispatchers are also being trained.

As of March 18, all city buildings are now closed to the public until further notice. Full directions on how to conduct City business functions, contact City departments, and participate in public meetings is all available on our website.

Under the emergency declaration the City Manager ordered on March 15 and as requested by the City Council, the City has decided to delay the implementation of a ban on single-use plastic bags for 90 days. The ban was scheduled to go into effect on April 1 and will now not be in effect until July 1.

This will give businesses impacted by this crisis more time to adapt to this new change. It is also in the best interest of safety not to introduce more reusable bags into circulation right now which could help spread the COVID-19 virus. There is evidence that viruses and bacteria can survive on reusable bags for up to 9 days.

The City has announced the formation of Worcester Together, a partnership between the City, the Greater Worcester Community Foundation and the United Way of Central Massachusetts. This partnership will help fund local relief efforts for COVID-19.

It will combine the efforts of the Greater Worcester Community Foundation’s COVID-19 Response Fund (for long-term recovery) and the United Way’s COVID-19 We Care Fund (for immediate, basic needs).

The Foundation’s COVID-19 Response Fund, seeded with $535,000, will serve the interim and long-term needs of groups working with people impacted by the virus. Donations can be made online at greaterworcester.org. Groups seeking assistance can also contact the Foundation directly through this website as well.

The United Way’s COVID-19 We Care Fund, seeded with $100,000, will provide a safety net for those hardest hit by COVID-19 in our community. To donate, please visit unitedwaycm.org.

Information on how to donate to both of these funds is available here.

The City and its MassHire Career Center are working closely with state partners to assist people and companies affected economically by the outbreak.

An expedited unemployment process has been implemented for claimants, and although the Career Center facility is closed, staff are still providing services remotely. Information for claimants and businesses is posted on the City website.

The City is working locally on the creation of a workforce matching tool to help connect those in good health looking for work with our local employers, including health care providers that have a critical shortage of staff needed to continue operations. This worker connection program will also be tapped as a way to help provide services to the most vulnerable among us, such as the elderly, that are not able to venture out to shop for themselves or access school meal programs.

Anyone that needs to file an unemployment claim should do so by using the online system (mass.gov/dua) as there will likely be delays for the phone system while the Department of Unemployment Assistance ramps up its remote call center. The City is assisting the department with staffing the remote call center with employees from the Career Center that are being temporarily reassigned.

Information on unemployment assistance has been added to the COVID-19 page on the city website at worcesterma.gov/coronavirus.

The Worcester Fire Department academy has been postponed until further notice. As an update to that, the recruits will be kept on the City payroll to assist with emergency operations as necessary (setting up shelter beds, etc.).

Regular WFD inspections of smoke detectors for home sales will continue as usual.

Worcester Police Department cruisers are being thoroughly cleaned and disinfected at the beginning and end of every shift, and our officers are following universal precautions and attempting to limit personal contact.

In addition, the Worcester Police will continue to answer all emergency calls.

For certain non-emergency calls, the Communications division will put the caller in touch with an officer to take a report over the phone. The non-emergency line is 508-799-8606.

Although the police lobby is open, please do not come in if your situation could be handled over the phone.

The License Division is closed to in-person visits. They can be reached by phone at 508-799-8648.

DPW walk-in service is closed. The Customer Service Center will still be available remotely by calling 508-929-1300 or by e-mailing dpw@worcesterma.gov.

Service requests can also be submitted using the online system at worcesterma.gov/customer-service. Trash and recycling services are on schedule.

Worcester drinking water is safe and unaffected by COVID-19. Worcester’s drinking water comes from well-protected reservoirs and is treated using ozone and chlorine, both powerful disinfectants that destroy viruses like COVID-19. Worcester area residents who get their water from the City of Worcester public water system should NOT be concerned about the safety of their tap water.

The Green Hill Park Farm and all playgrounds and are closed until further notice. City parks and open spaces remain open.

1,390 meals were delivered to the senior community on March 18 by Meals on Wheels.

Of 600 registered seniors at the Worcester Senior Center, we've reached out to 150 of them today for wellness checks.

The City will continue to make these daily calls to support the ongoing needs of seniors and connect them to the appropriate services.

Our cultural community is coming together to ensure that physical isolation does not lead to social isolation. Many of our local performers and entertainers have utilized social media to perform live shows and we encourage our community to log on, seek them out and support them however they are able.
In addition to these efforts, the Worcester Cultural Coalition is encouraging people to send videos and photos that can uplift, encourage and foster creativity to culture@worcesterma.gov. Some examples could be reading books for children, hosting virtual tours, and past performances that have been recorded to be redistributed.

The Cultural Coalition plans to host and circulate this creative outpouring of content in an effort to keep spirits high and sustain our community spirit. This will also provide an online educational vehicle for our school children and their families to enjoy while they are at home.
Our COVID-19 information line can be reached at 508-799-1019. This service is available in English, Spanish, Vietnamese and, beginning March 18, Albanian. Starting Thursday, March 19, there will be an option for individuals with positive or pending test results to speak with a nurse in DPH, Monday through Friday 9 am to 4 pm.
